Certainly, I'll break down the code and explain each part:

Importing necessary libraries:

pythonCopyfrom fyers_api import accessToken
from fyers_api import fyersModel
import os
from dotenv import load_dotenv
These lines import the required modules. We're using the Fyers API, os for environment variables, and dotenv to load variables from a .env file.

Loading environment variables:

pythonCopyload_dotenv()
This loads variables from a .env file in the same directory as your script.

Setting up credentials:

pythonCopyclient_id = os.getenv('FYERS_CLIENT_ID')
secret_key = os.getenv('FYERS_SECRET_KEY')
redirect_uri = os.getenv('FYERS_REDIRECT_URI')
We're getting the Fyers credentials from environment variables for security.

Creating a session:

pythonCopysession = accessToken.SessionModel(
    client_id=client_id,
    secret_key=secret_key,
    redirect_uri=redirect_uri,
    response_type='code',
    grant_type='authorization_code'
)
This creates a SessionModel object with your Fyers credentials.

Generating the auth code:

pythonCopyresponse = session.generate_authcode()
print("Login URL:", response)
This generates a login URL. You'll need to open this URL in a browser to log in.

Getting the auth code:

pythonCopyauth_code = input("Enter the auth code from the redirected URL: ")
After logging in, you'll be redirected to your redirect URI with an auth code. You need to copy this code and paste it when prompted.

Generating the access token:

pythonCopysession.set_token(auth_code)
response = session.generate_token()
access_token = response["access_token"]
This uses the auth code to generate an access token.

Creating a FyersModel instance:

pythonCopyfyers = fyersModel.FyersModel(client_id=client_id, token=access_token, log_path="")
This creates a FyersModel object that you'll use to make API calls.

Testing the connection:

pythonCopyprofile = fyers.get_profile()
print("Profile:", profile)
This makes a simple API call to get your profile information, confirming that the connection is working.
To use this script:

Install the required libraries (fyers_api and python-dotenv).
Create a .env file with your Fyers credentials (FYERS_CLIENT_ID, FYERS_SECRET_KEY, FYERS_REDIRECT_URI).
Run the script.
Open the login URL in a browser when prompted.
After logging in, you'll be redirected. Copy the auth code from the URL and paste it into the console when prompted.

The script will then generate an access token and create a FyersModel instance that you can use for further API calls.
